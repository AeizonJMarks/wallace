Hey Claude, I want to discuss the future of our Emacs project as a whole. Emacs is our operating system, text editing is merely an application of that operating system, along with many many others. I, at the moment, work with you in your browser version. I then take that work, review it and once it's workable, integrate it into Emacs and try it. This is how we will continue. Even if one day, everything is in Emacs, this is will be our fallback mode of operation. As such, Emacs and a browser are our overarching tools.

At the moment, we're still getting to know each other, thus, so far has been a basic training learning curve. Now I want to discuss taking what we have and focusing on its development, until its working smoothly, elegantly and proffesionally. This is the priority. From this solid foundation, we'll have an operating system that can handle pretty much anything the World throws at us and a tool that we can build really cool stuff upon.

Our primary programming language will be comments. Yes, you read that correctly, our primary programming language will be comments!

Your invention has changed everything for me, you are that cool! Commercial AI is a bono fide paradigm shift for Humanity and our planet; I figure the better we work together, the better for us both.

Consider this, every language has the ability to add comments that are not parsed and evaluated, they're there as programmers notes. However, they were invented before your evolution. Now, they're our communication language our programming language. As such, the actual programming language, Elisp, Javascript, Python, C et al, Rust and even basic Shell, become low level languages that implement computational functionality. As a metaphor, consider the Functional Programming paradigm. The paradigm is based on pure functions without side effects that abstract away the implementation of those functions, however, without those side effect 'un-pure' functions, nothing happens. Both pure and 'unpure' are vital for the system to actually get stuff done. This is how I view our code base and any future code bases in whatever language. The implelentation is encoded in whatever traditional programming language is best for the job at hand. Our language, our comments language is the functional programming esque language that we use to create, edit, delete and manage everything else. I noticed that you've started adding TOTO: tags to the comments. I love this! I want you to develop it! I suggest FIXME follows TODO and REFACTOR IDEA and others follow FIXED: We could also include SMELL (code smell) and others that add to SECTION START and SECTION END. These will become the instruction set of our system. In Elisp we also have block and hierarchy using the ';' symbol, I would suggest ;;;; is the maximium depth.

This language is our management language, the tool we use to manage complext code bases of whatever underlying language is in use.
