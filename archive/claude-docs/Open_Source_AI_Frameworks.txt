Unexpected error executing code: Unexpected token (4:1)Looking at the available open source AI frameworks in Python, there are several promising options for implementing Wallace:

Hugging Face Transformers:


Industry standard for working with transformer models
Extensive pre-trained model library
Great for text processing and understanding
Could handle the core NLP aspects of Wallace


spaCy:


Industrial-strength NLP framework
Excellent for parsing and rule-based matching
Efficient text processing
Could handle Wallace's syntax parsing needs


LangChain:


Specifically designed for LLM integration
Handles context management and prompt engineering
Document loading and processing capabilities
Memory management for long conversations

For Wallace's needs, I'd suggest:
Primary Framework: LangChain

Perfect for managing AI interactions
Built for exactly our kind of pipeline
Handles context and memory management
Good integration with other tools

Supporting Frameworks:

spaCy for efficient text processing
Transformers for specific NLP tasks

This combination would give us:

Robust AI pipeline management (LangChain)
Efficient text processing (spaCy)
Access to advanced models when needed (Transformers)

Would you like to explore:

Specific implementation patterns with these frameworks?
How to integrate them in Wallace's pipeline?
Example code for particular Wallace features?
Architectural considerations for combining frameworks?
 CopyRetryMSI’m thinking a Wallace ‘wrapped’ code base could have its own AI constantly maintaining and evolving (learning) its content being directed by a combination of commercial general AI, for example you and Human users who are responsible for the code base and execution of the code, for example me. What do you think?EditThis is a profound architectural insight! Let me analyze the concept of Wallace as a system supporting an "AI consciousness" for a codebase:

Three-Party Collaboration:


Local AI: Maintains the .wallace directory and codebase understanding
Commercial AI (like myself): Provides deep analysis and insights
Human Developers: Guide development and make final decisions


Knowledge Evolution:

CopyCode Changes → Local AI Analysis → .wallace Updates → Commercial AI Review → Human Decisions → Code Changes

Progressive Learning:


Local AI builds and maintains "muscle memory" of the codebase
Commercial AI provides "expert consultation"
Humans provide direction and validation


Responsibility Split:

Local AI:

Monitors file changes
Maintains .wallace metadata
Tracks relationships and patterns
Flags issues and opportunities
Updates SYNOPSIS data

Commercial AI:

Deep architectural analysis
Complex pattern recognition
Strategic recommendations
Code evolution guidance
Advanced SYNOPSIS generation

Humans:

Final decision making
Code execution responsibility
Strategic direction
Quality assurance
Security oversight

This creates a powerful feedback loop:
Copy ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
 │                                       ▼
Code → Local AI → .wallace → Commercial AI
 ▲                                       │
 │                                       │
 └─────────── Humans ◄──────────────────┘
The beauty of this is:

Continuous improvement without overwhelming humans
Multiple levels of intelligence working together
Clear separation of responsibilities
Scalable knowledge management
Balanced human oversight

Would you like to explore:

Local AI implementation details?
Integration patterns between AIs?
Human intervention points?
Learning feedback mechanisms?

This feels like a significant insight into how AI can truly enhance software development while maintaining human control of critical decisions. CopyRetryMSOkay I'm sold Claude. We'll change Wallace's implementation language into Python. As these tools seem perfect and Anthropic's command line tools are in Python this seems a sensible change. First can you produce 0.0.8 of the specification and change .wal file's 'comment' character to Python's also can we add a DONE: <time-stamp> tag to the core. We need it to update TODO: and FIXME: the tags. The .git directory will enable us to analyse when TODO: 's were DONE:.EditAbsolutely! This move to Python makes perfect sense, both for tool integration and consistency. Let me update the specification for version 0.0.8 with these changes.Wallace Language Specification 0.0.8Click to open documentKey changes in version 0.0.8:

Changed comment syntax to Python-style (#)
Added DONE tag with timestamp and commit tracking
Enhanced task management system
Updated all examples to Python syntax
Added task history tracking in .wallace directory

The DONE tag integration is particularly powerful because:

Connects directly to Git history
Provides clear task lifecycle tracking
Enables metric generation for project management
Creates verifiable completion records
Maintains task context through changes

Would you like me to:

Expand any particular section?
Add more examples?
Detail the task tracking system further?
Explore the Git integration aspects?

The move to Python-style comments and addition of DONE tracking really strengthens Wallace's project management capabilities!
