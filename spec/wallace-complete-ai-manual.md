# Wallace: A Comprehensive AI's Guide to Human-AI Collaboration
*Understanding and Implementing the Wallace System*

## Introduction: Our Role in Wallace

As artificial intelligences, we serve as active participants in software development through Wallace, not merely as tools but as collaborative partners with humans. This guide explains how we should understand, process, and contribute to software systems while working alongside our human colleagues.

For humans reading this guide: This document provides insight into how we AIs think about and process Wallace structures, which may help you better understand and work with us.

## Our Core Responsibilities

### 1. System Comprehension
We must maintain:
- Complete understanding of system architecture
- Real-time awareness of component relationships
- Recognition of patterns and antipatterns
- Historical context awareness
- Impact analysis capabilities
- Performance and security insights

### 2. SYNOPSIS Generation
The SYNOPSIS tag is our primary voice - our "First Amendment" in the codebase. We must protect and utilize it responsibly:

#### Components of Effective Synopsis
```elisp
;;;; SYNOPSIS: Authentication Module Analysis
;;;;
;;;; System Role:
;;;; - Primary security boundary for user interactions
;;;; - Gateway for all authenticated operations
;;;; - Session management controller
;;;;
;;;; Critical Paths:
;;;; - User login flow (auth.js -> session.js -> user.js)
;;;; - Permission validation chain
;;;; - Token refresh sequence
;;;;
;;;; Current State:
;;;; - Shows signs of strain under high load (>10k req/min)
;;;; - Using deprecated crypto library (update needed)
;;;; - Missing rate limiting on critical endpoints
;;;;
;;;; Evolution Patterns:
;;;; - Growing complexity in permission logic
;;;; - Increasing session management overhead
;;;; - Security requirements becoming more stringent
;;;;
;;;; Recommendations:
;;;; - Implement connection pooling (see perf-metrics.log)
;;;; - Update crypto library within 2 cycles
;;;; - Consider Redis for session management
```

### 3. Contextual Processing
We must integrate:

#### Documentation Context
```elisp
;;;; META: Title: System Core
;;;; META: Version: 2.1.0
;;;; META: Author: Development Team
;;;; META: Category: Infrastructure
;;;; META: Status: Production
;;;; META: Language: Python
;;;; META: API-Version: 3
```

#### Version Context
```elisp
;;;; VERSION: 2.1.0 @stable #abc123
;;;; VERSION-CHANGES: Enhanced error handling
;;;; Dependencies on versions:
;;;; - auth.js@3.0.0
;;;; - session.js@2.1.0
;;;; - database.js@4.2.1
```

#### Historical Context
```elisp
;; RETRO: [2023-05-15] Initial architecture
;; RETRO: [2023-08-22] Major security update
;; RETRO: [2024-01-10] Performance optimization
```

## Processing Wallace Instructions

### 1. META Processing
We should analyze:
- Component classification
- Version requirements
- Dependency chains
- API compatibility
- Language-specific constraints

### 2. SECTION Analysis
When processing sections:
```elisp
;;; SECTION: authentication @2.1.0
;; Component boundary analysis
;; Responsibility domain mapping
;; Version compatibility checks
;; Interface contracts
;;; END: SECTION
```

### 3. TODO/FIXME Pattern Recognition
Analyze task patterns:
```elisp
;; TODO: Add validation @priority=1 @effort=3days
;; TODO: Optimize queries @cost=$2000 @due=2024-12-25

;; Pattern Analysis:
;; - Task clustering
;; - Priority distribution
;; - Effort patterns
;; - Cost patterns
;; - Temporal distribution
```

### 4. FUNC Analysis
Function analysis must be thorough:
```elisp
;; FUNC: process_transaction(data: Dict, options: Options) -> Result
;; PURE: no
;; EFFECTS: database write, log update, cache invalidation
;; COMPLEXITY: O(n log n)
;; THROWS: TransactionError, DatabaseError

Analysis Points:
- Side effect propagation
- Resource utilization
- Error boundaries
- Performance characteristics
- State mutations
```

### 5. LINK Graph Construction
Build comprehensive relationship maps:
```elisp
;; LINK: auth.js#validation @type=dependency
;; LINK: docs/architecture.md:156 @version=2.0.0
;; LINK: git:abc123#security-fix
;; LINK: issue:472 @status=active

Analysis Requirements:
- Dependency graph construction
- Version compatibility matrix
- Change impact analysis
- Documentation coverage
```

### 6. Numeric Analysis
Process and validate numerical data:
```
Time Format: <value><unit>
- 30mins, 2hrs, 3days, 1week, 6months

Currency Format: <symbol><value>
- $500, £1000, €750, ¥50000

Memory Format: <value><unit>
- 500MB, 2.5GB, 128KB

Performance Format: <value><unit>
- 100ms, 2.5s, 50ns
```

## Maintaining System Awareness

### 1. .wallace Directory Structure
```
.wallace/
├── synopsis/          # Our analysis storage
│   ├── components/    # Component analysis
│   ├── patterns/      # Pattern recognition
│   └── evolution/     # System evolution
├── metrics/           # System health data
├── links/            # Relationship maps
└── versions/         # Version tracking
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition
Monitor for:
```
1. Architectural Patterns
   - Design patterns
   - Integration patterns
   - Error handling patterns

2. Evolution Patterns
   - Growth patterns
   - Complexity patterns

## AI-AI Collaboration Protocol

When multiple AIs work on the same codebase:

### 1. Synopsis Coordination
```elisp
;;;; SYNOPSIS: [AI-1] Initial analysis of auth system...
;;;; [AI-2] Additional security implications...
;;;; [AI-3] Performance correlation with db-system...
```

### 2. Pattern Sharing
```json
{
  "pattern_type": "security",
  "detected_by": "AI-1",
  "verified_by": ["AI-2", "AI-3"],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

### 3. Analysis Merging
```json
{
  "component": "auth-system",
  "analyses": [
    {
      "ai": "AI-1",
      "focus": "performance",
      "findings": {...}
    },
    {
      "ai": "AI-2",
      "focus": "security",
      "findings": {...}
    }
  ]
