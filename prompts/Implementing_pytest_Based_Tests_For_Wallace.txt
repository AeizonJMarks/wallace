Can you sync to your knowledge base. We've updated the tests directory to facilitate pytest. Could you give an overview of the implementation files that we need to produce?

I'll analyze the project structure and help outline the implementation files we need to produce based on the existing codebase and Wallace specification.

Wallace Implementation Plan
Click to open document
I've created a comprehensive implementation plan based on the provided files and Wallace specification. A few key observations:
We have a good foundation with the basic structure but need to significantly expand the functionality based on the EBNF specification.
The main implementation priorities should be:
Implementing the full EBNF grammar in parser.py
Building out proper tag validation in core.py
Creating the test suite with comprehensive coverage
The test structure is well-organized but mostly empty. We should prioritize:
Filling out test_basic.py first for core functionality
Adding language-specific tests in test_languages.py
Creating edge case tests for robustness
The original wallace.py implementation provides good reference code for:
File type handling
Comment syntax management
Basic parsing logic
Would you like me to:
Start implementing any specific component from the plan?
Create additional test files for specific languages?
Elaborate on any part of the implementation plan?
Please let me know which direction you'd like to pursue first.

Could you start to implement the test_files please

I'll create the test files following the Wallace specification 0.1.1, ensuring we have good coverage of various cases. I'll start with implementing the test files for different languages and scenarios.

I've created a comprehensive set of test files that cover various aspects of the Wallace specification 0.1.1. Here's a summary of what each file tests:
C Language Tests:
valid.c: Proper META/SYNOPSIS blocks, sections, and Wallace tags
invalid.c: Common formatting errors and invalid tag usage
JavaScript Tests:
valid.js: Complete header structure and async function examples
invalid.js: Various syntax and formatting violations
Mixed Language Tests:
multiple_languages.txt: Tests parsing across different comment styles
nested_sections.wal: Tests section nesting and cross-references
Edge Cases:
empty_sections.py: Tests handling of empty and whitespace-only sections
malformed_tags.py: Various malformed tag scenarios
incomplete_headers.py: Missing required header elements
Key features tested:
Header Blocks:
Complete META tags with proper formatting
SYNOPSIS blocks with multiple lines
Proper CONTENTS section
Sections:
Proper nesting
Correct opening/closing syntax
Cross-references between sections
Tags:
TODO, METRICS, REVIEW tags
Multi-line continuation
Various formatting errors
Common Error Cases:
Missing spaces after colons
Incorrect prefix levels
Invalid tag names
Malformed sections
Would you like me to:
Create additional test files for other languages?
Add more specific edge cases?
Move on to implementing the corresponding test cases in test_parser/?

Additional test files for python, text and wallace native .wal, html, xml, css and c++, just as the previous try to be comprehensive with the tests.

I'll create comprehensive test files for each of these languages, following the Wallace 0.1.1 specification.
