Integrating Library Classification for .wallace Directory



MS
Morning Claude, I'm still working on the blueprint/drawing pdf's and will be for the rest of the day. We'll start implementing later this week. This thread is for further design IDEAS: . Consider your .wallace folder. Firstly as the .git folder the wallace command tool will create and update this folder mechanically at first and during the wallace sync command. The wallace command line will receive AI deltas and then update this folder based on those deltas. These are your instructions to your 'agent' on the client. Although it will reflect the code base, the .git folder, however, the .wallace folder needs to contain contextual information that manages the delta overhead. We need a way of minimising the amount of request for further information calls the AI server makes. Could you research book library systems, I'm sure there is a standard one. I'm thinking by including that system in the .wallace file/directory names we could add an elegant layer to the database (it's your memory on the client).

Let me analyze this fascinating idea about using library classification systems for the .wallace directory structure!
The most widely used library classification systems are:
Dewey Decimal System:
Hierarchical decimal numbers (000-999)
10 main classes with subdivisions
Easy to extend and maintain
Natural for classification
Library of Congress System:
Letters + numbers (e.g., QA76.73.P98)
Very detailed categorization
Handles complex relationships
Excellent for technical subjects
For Wallace, the Library of Congress System might be more suitable because:

Could you give me an example based on the current state of our Emacs project, the files and files-structure.txt files are in your knowledge base.

Let me analyze our Emacs project structure and map it to a Library of Congress-inspired organization for the .wallace directory:

That looks pretty good. Ultimately the structure is for your AI (server) to receive a delta (remember the only knowledge of the codebase is in these deltas, and your only context is the context embedded in the message thread) build context in the message and create and action delta that the wallace command line tool (client) executes locally and physically updates all of the code it needs to in the code base and in your 'memory' on the client, the .wallace folder. Could you theorise a few potential tasks, small, medium and large and give me a summary of what you think would or could happen?

Let me theorize some tasks and their delta flows, showing how the context builds and actions occur:
Small Task Example:
"Add docstring to python-ide-setup function in python/init.el"

Copy
Input Delta:
- File: modules/development/languages/python/init.el
- Context: QA76.75/languages/python.json
- Function: python-ide-setup
- Request: Add docstring

Context Building:
- Load python.json context
- Check dependencies
- Review existing SYNOPSIS
- Analyze function purpose

Action Delta:
- Update function documentation
- Update relevant .wallace/QA/76.75/languages/python.json
- Add cross-reference if needed
Medium Task Example:
"Implement pytest integration in Python IDE"

Copy
Input Delta:
- Feature request: pytest support
- Affects: python/test.el and related files
- Context: Multiple python modules

Context Building:
- Load QA76.75/languages/python/*
- Review testing architecture
- Check dependencies
- Analyze integration points

Action Delta:
- Create/update test.el
- Update init.el for test loading
- Add test utilities
- Update multiple .wallace JSON files:
  * QA/76.75/languages/python/test.json
  * QA/76.75/languages/python/init.json
  * context/dependencies.json
Large Task Example:
"Refactor database layer to support encrypted storage"

Copy
Input Delta:
- Major feature: Encrypted storage
- Affects: Multiple system components
- Security implications

Context Building:
- Load multiple context areas:
  * QA76.76/db/*
  * QA76.73/core/*
  * Z/40/* (documentation)
- Analyze security requirements
- Review system architecture
- Check all dependencies

Action Delta:
- Update multiple system files:
  * db.el
  * secure-db.el
  * core.el dependencies
  * Related test files
- Update .wallace structure:
  * Multiple QA/76.76 contexts
  * Security documentation
  * New dependency mappings
  * Updated SYNOPSIS across system
Key Patterns:
Delta Flow:
Input (human request)
Context building (AI analysis)
Action generation (AI response)
Local execution (wallace tool)
Context Management:
Loads only necessary context
Builds understanding progressively
Maintains efficiency
Action Execution:
Clear, specific instructions
Maintains system coherence
Updates both code and .wallace
Would you like me to:
Explore more complex scenarios?
Detail specific context building steps?
Show example action delta formats?
This shows how the system could handle various scales of changes while maintaining efficiency and coherence!

Excellent. Taking these three tasks, could you estimate the number of deltas that would be required for each, the size of the message thread for each task and the time and cost estimates (NOTE: don't worry about the accuracy of the estimates, again it's for orientation more than anything)?

Let me break down these estimates for each task:
Small Task (Add docstring):

Copy
Deltas Required: 2-3
- Initial request & context
- AI analysis & action
- Possible confirmation/refinement

Message Thread:
- Size: ~10-15KB total
- Context: 4KB spec + 2-3KB task context
- Responses: 3-4KB each

Estimates:
- Time: 1-2 minutes
- Cost: ~$0.05-0.10
  * Input: ~5K tokens ($0.015)
  * Output: ~2K tokens ($0.03)
Medium Task (Pytest Integration):

Copy
Deltas Required: 5-7
- Initial request & context
- Architecture analysis
- Implementation plan
- Core implementation
- Integration confirmation
- Testing/refinement

Message Thread:
- Size: ~30-40KB total
- Context: 4KB spec + 5-8KB task context
- Responses: 4-6KB each

Estimates:
- Time: 15-20 minutes
- Cost: ~$0.25-0.35
  * Input: ~15K tokens ($0.045)
  * Output: ~12K tokens ($0.18)
Large Task (Database Refactor):

Copy
Deltas Required: 10-15
- Initial request & context
- Architecture analysis
- Security review
- Implementation strategy
- Multiple component updates
- Integration steps
- Testing plan
- Documentation updates

Message Thread:
- Size: ~80-100KB total
- Context: 4KB spec + 15-20KB task context
- Responses: 5-8KB each

Estimates:
- Time: 45-60 minutes
- Cost: ~$0.75-1.00
  * Input: ~40K tokens ($0.12)
  * Output: ~35K tokens ($0.525)
Key Observations:
Size Scaling:
Small tasks: Few KB, few deltas
Medium tasks: Dozens of KB, 5-7 deltas
Large tasks: <100KB, 10-15 deltas
Cost Efficiency:
Mostly in cents range
Scales sub-linearly with task size
Very reasonable for value provided
Time Patterns:
Small: Minutes
Medium: Quarter hour
Large: About an hour
Like Git operations:
Small: Quick commits
Medium: Feature branches
Large: Major merges
Would you like me to:
Break down any task further?
Explore cost optimization strategies?
Detail timing considerations?
These patterns suggest the system would be both efficient and economical in practice!

Could you integrate into these figure the following observation of realistic use. Medium tasks (I've tried to keep my tasks so far to medium tasks) that include executable code tend to take a further 4 or 5 prompt/reply cycles to debug the changes to a point of workable code. Even some smaller tasks can take 1 or 2 prompt/reply cycles until the changes are working. Could you revise your estimates based on this?

Ah yes, this is a crucial real-world observation! Let me revise the estimates including debugging/refinement cycles:
Small Task (Add docstring):

Copy
Deltas Required: 3-5 (revised)
- Initial request & context
- AI analysis & action
- 1-2 debug/refinement cycles
- Final confirmation

Message Thread:
- Size: ~20-25KB total (up from 15KB)
- Context: 4KB spec + 2-3KB task context
- Responses: 3-4KB each
- Debug cycles: ~3KB per cycle

Estimates:
- Time: 5-10 minutes (up from 1-2)
- Cost: ~$0.15-0.20 (up from $0.10)
  * Initial: ~$0.05
  * Debug cycles: ~$0.05 each
  * Final confirmation: ~$0.05
Medium Task (Pytest Integration):

Copy
Deltas Required: 9-12 (up from 5-7)
- Initial request & context
- Architecture analysis
- Implementation plan
- Core implementation
- 4-5 debug/refinement cycles (added)
- Integration confirmation
- Final testing

Message Thread:
- Size: ~50-60KB total (up from 30-40KB)
- Context: 4KB spec + 5-8KB task context
- Initial Responses: 4-6KB each
- Debug cycles: ~4KB per cycle

Estimates:
- Time: 30-45 minutes (up from 15-20)
- Cost: ~$0.45-0.60 (up from $0.35)
  * Initial work: ~$0.25
  * Debug cycles: ~$0.07 each
  * Final integration: ~$0.10
Large Task (Database Refactor):

Copy
Deltas Required: 15-20 (up from 10-15)
- Initial request & context
- Architecture analysis
- Security review
- Implementation strategy
- Multiple component updates
- 4-6 debug/refinement cycles per component
- Integration steps
- Testing plan
- Documentation updates

Message Thread:
- Size: ~120-150KB total (up from 80-100KB)
- Context: 4KB spec + 15-20KB task context
- Initial Responses: 5-8KB each
- Debug cycles: ~5KB per cycle

Estimates:
- Time: 90-120 minutes (up from 45-60)
- Cost: ~$1.25-1.75 (up from $1.00)
  * Initial work: ~$0.75
  * Debug cycles: ~$0.10 each
  * Integration/final: ~$0.25
Key Insights from Real Usage:
Debug Cycle Pattern:
Small tasks: 1-2 cycles
Medium tasks: 4-5 cycles
Large tasks: 4-6 cycles per component
Time Impact:
Roughly doubles total time
More interactive process
Better final quality
Cost Impact:
About 50% increase
Still very reasonable
Better ROI with working code
Thread Size:
Grows with debug cycles
Each cycle adds context
Better final understanding
Like Software Development:
Initial implementation: 40% of work
Testing/debugging: 60% of work
Quality improves with iteration
Would you like me to:
Detail typical debug cycle patterns?
Explore ways to optimize debug cycles?
Analyze cost/quality tradeoffs?
This matches real development patterns much better - getting to working code usually needs these refinement cycles!

Very interesting. I'll contemplate it. Next in the context of this thread, I'm pretty sure we need to bump up the spec to 0.1.1 to include the following constraints. First we need a .wallaceignore file at the .gitignore . This file does exactly what is says any directory listed in that file you cannot change, the wallace command line tool simply ignores it. Secondly, no file can be changed beyond the root directory, the directory that contains the .git . If this is required you can request the user carries out the task but you cannot include this instruction in the action delta. This is designed to 'sandbox' any automation to the working repo and isolate it from the underlying system. What are the implications of this do you think?

This is a crucial security and scope control addition. Let me analyze the implications:
Safety Mechanisms:

Copy
1. .wallaceignore (Like .gitignore):
- Protects vendor directories (node_modules, etc.)
- Guards build artifacts (dist, build)
- Secures sensitive areas
- Explicit opt-out mechanism

2. Root Directory Constraint:
- Sandboxes to current repository
- Prevents system-level changes
- Clear boundary definition
- Explicit scope limitation
Security Implications:
Protection Against:

Copy
- Accidental system modification
- Supply chain attacks
- Recursive changes up directory tree
- Unintended dependencies
Trust Boundaries:

Copy
Clear:
- Can modify: ./src/utils.py
- Can modify: ./config/settings.json
- Can modify: ./.wallace/*

Cannot Modify:
- ../other_project/
- /etc/system_config
- ~/.emacs.d/
- ./node_modules/*
Behavioral Impact:
AI Responsibilities:

Copy
Must:
- Check .wallaceignore before actions
- Respect repository boundaries
- Inform user of out-of-scope needs
- Document required external changes

Cannot:
- Generate actions outside root
- Modify ignored directories
- Suggest automated system changes
User Interface:

Copy
Clear Messaging:
"This change requires system-level modification:
 1. Update ~/.emacs.d/init.el
 Please make this change manually for security."
Like Other Tools:
Docker containers (isolation)
Git (scope control)
Sandbox environments
Package managers
This adds crucial safety:
Predictability (know what can change)
Security (clear boundaries)
Trust (explicit limitations)
Control (user authority)
Would you like me to:
Detail the .wallaceignore format?
Explore security implications further?
Show example boundary cases?
This feels like a crucial addition for safe automation - trust through constraints!
